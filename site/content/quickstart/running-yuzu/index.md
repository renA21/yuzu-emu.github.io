## Running yuzu

We will now run yuzu to verify that your dumped keys and games are being read correctly.

1. Run either the `yuzu` or `yuzu Early Access` shortcuts that were created by the yuzu installer tool.
2. in yuzu, click on `+ Add New Game Directory` in the browser, and navigate to the folder where you placed your `XCI` or `NSP` files.
